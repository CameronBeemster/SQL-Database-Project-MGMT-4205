# Database Management Project (MGMT 4205)

This database project was a final project for the database management class (MGMT 4205)
at the University of Colorado - Boulder. We were given unstructured data from the website https://phandroid.com/ - around 20,000,000 rows - and designed a database . Included with the code is the slide deck from our presentation, as well as a report covering the structure and design of the database.
